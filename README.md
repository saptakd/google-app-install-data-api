# google-app-install-data-api
Every App in the Google Playstore has it's statistical data stored in the Google Cloud servers on a daily basis. The Company's management may need the statistics like daily installs, daily uninstalls, total downloads, total active users, etc. for their own use. Instead of manually accessing these reports from the Google Cloud which leads to errors and wastage of manhours, the developers can automatically fetch the reports using the Google Gsutil and this api to fetch the reports and store it in their respective databases by setting up a CRON.
